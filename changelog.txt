  D3D11 - Direct3D 11 hardware feature level 10.1 minimum, feature level 11.0 for compute shaders

               r_backend | GL2    | GL3    | D3D11              |
  feature                |        |        |                    |
  -----------------------|--------|--------|--------------------|
  MSAA                   | GL 3.0 | always | always             |

  r_gpuMipGen 1 is required
  it should be closer to 2.4 but defaults lower to not break the looks of some things (e.g. cpm3a tele)

add: r_lightmapGreyscale <0.0 to 1.0> (default: 0) to control how monochromatic the lightmaps look
  r_lightmapGreyscale 0 = full color (nothing done)
  r_lightmapGreyscale 1 = completely monochrome

add: r_mapBrightness now works on q3map2's external lightmap atlas images

add: the renderer can now batch surfaces with different (but sufficiently similar) shaders
  this new optimization works with the output of "Frozen Sand Particle Studio"

chg: removed FreeType 2 and the unused R_REGISTERFONT syscalls that were using it

chg: removed light flares and all related cvars (r_flare*)

	r_textureMode GL_NEAREST    = LEGO(R) mode - nearest-neighbor filtering for a subset of surfaces
	r_textureMode anything else = normal  mode - the engine picks the most appropriate filters

chg: r_measureOverdraw was removed

  it now also supports surfaces referencing q3map2's "external lightmap" atlas images

chg: negative r_swapInterval values will request adaptive v-sync when using an OpenGL back-end

fix: crash due to lack of memory for the sound system

fix: incorrect shader state when loading a map with no lighting

fix: fog-only non-sky shaders were incorrectly handled as sky shaders, which broke fog on many maps

add: new CNQ3 download system that uses checksums to get the right pak files
  the CNQ3 download system will use the WorldSpawn map server for inexact queries
  (when loading demos or using /dlmap) when the CNQ3 map server doesn't have the file

  system | speed | cases               | source(s)     | file availability | server requirements

  this means 2 CNQ3 processes run per server: a parent (fixed pid) and a child (new pid after each restart)
  this behavior can be disabled by passing "nohardreboot" as a command-line argument
  the new command sv_restartProcess can be used to shut down the child process and start a new one

chg: the client requires SDL 2 - the following things are handled by it:
  window, GL context, video modes, audio, kb and mouse input, monitor list, clipboard

chg: tty input behavior matches in-game behavior when cgame is running and fixed the truncated tty input

add: dynamic light by GLSL shaders

add: r_maplightBrightness (from 0 to 8) and r_maplightSaturation(0-4). to use this parameters set r_maplightColorMode 1.

add: r_maplightColorMode to configure lightmaps

add: r_mode can be set resolution and frequency display. For example, r_mode "640x480@100"

fix: in_mouse -1 kept relocating the system cursor even if not focused

fix: implement the sound change from 1.45 *correctly*  :P

fix: default build does not create option r_smp. To assemble the build 
      with the option r_smp need to use preprocessor USE_R_SMP

fix: small fixes to CVA rendering code

fix: fix opStack and rename targets for unix

fix: GTV/spectator can't change POV after map changed

fix: render shader time overflow (fix splashdamage bug).

fix: mouse event queue


24 Nov 09 - 1.46

add: hopefully worked around some vistajoke mousewheel issues

add: m_limit (default: 0 = off), the maximum post-accel speed to use

chg: sensitivity renamed to m_speed

chg: rewrote pretty much all the mouse code

chg: removed the DI code in favor of "raw" mouse input
  this means only mouse1-mouse5 are supported on windows, sigh MS...

chg: updated freetype from 2.3.5 to 2.3.11


05 Nov 09 - 1.45
note: this release REQUIRES arb shader support
  if your card doesn't have it, use an older version

add: hw gamma should work on Vista

add: r_measureoverdraw is actually useful

add: r_speeds is far more useful now

chg: sound attenuation is biased
  i.e. distant sounds are much louder than in 1.43
  since it's still more correctly spatialised than pre-1.43, this is
  the best compromise i can come up with

chg: r_fullbright works in vertexlight mode (only)
  instead of lightmap only, where it just wasted bandwidth and vram

chg: r_customwidth, r_customheight renamed to r_width, r_height

chg: hardcoded r_mode garbage and modelist removed:
  r_mode 0 (default) = current desktop resolution, depth, hz, etc
  r_mode 1 = custom resolution etc
  note: r_mode 1 WILL NOT tolerate invalid r_displayRefresh values any more

chg: require opengl 1.4 or higher
  removed r_allowExtensions, r_primitives, r_ext_compiled_vertex_array,
  r_ext_multitexture, r_ext_texture_env_add

chg: removed a bunch of useless/obsolete cvars:
  r_logfile, r_showcluster, r_facePlaneCull, r_ignoreFastPath, r_drawSun,
  r_simpleMipMaps, r_offsetFactor, r_offsetUnits

chg: don't tablist cheatvar noise if cheats are off

chg: removed the last bits of legacy altivec cruft

chg: rewrote pretty much all the dlight stuff
  not only does it actually work reliably now
  but it's also massively improved in terms of quality

fix: ignorehwgamma 1 would fail to apply sw gamma to some images

fix: roqs failed to apply sw gamma

fix: sv_floodprotect could block all commands indefinitely


12 Aug 09 - 1.44 (server only)

fix: unbannable player exploit (stanway/auriemma)


08 Aug 08 - 1.43

fixed sfx0 using a real sound and thus "hiding" it

corrected sv_pure back to CVAR_ROM

added the correct "fastsky!=0 == disable portals" test, ffs me  :P

removed long-obsoleted r_lastValidRenderer

removed long-obsoleted r_ext_gamma_control

removed pointless cl_forceavidemo

removed r_rail* and marked the never-used RT_BEAM etc as such

removed RAVENMD4 completely

r_fullbright is not a cheat var

fixed a bug with CVAR_CHEAT

fixed another bug in \video (hopefully)

fixed distance culling on dlit patch seams

changed r_ext_max_anisotropy default to 16

added con_scale for console font scaling
0 = Q3 style, always 8x12 pixels regardless of screen rez
1 = Q4 style, scales with screen rez
!0 = scale with screen rez and a custom multiplier

straightened out the con cvar mess:
cl_noprint -> con_noprint
scr_conspeed -> con_speed and correctly CVAR_ARCHIVE
con_notifytime correctly CVAR_ARCHIVE
removed cl_conXOffset since it basically doesn't work

sleep correctly if an unfocused client (win32-only)
don't sleep INcorrectly if a dedicated server (win32-only)

fixed a (huge) memory leak in the vm

fixed sv_pure 1 problems on listen servers

another overhaul of the sound code:

spatialisation is now correct, which has two huge impacts:
  you can "place" sounds MUCH more accurately than before,
  but as a result, distant sounds are MUCH quieter

removed s_doppler, it's almost right but it just sounds like shit

most of the s_mixprestep hackery has been removed, and you can
probably set it to 0 if your sound drivers work properly

OAL support has been dropped completely and indefinitely
  it's crap and i'm tired of it poisoning the codebase


Mar 08 - 1.42

bots are no longer kicked by devmap

legacy cack like joystick/midi support only pollutes configs if enabled

fixed a memory leak in the sound code

fixed even more (hopefully all) dropped sound issues in snd_dma

made com_soundmegs SLIGHTLY less broken: now only 2x instead of 3x  :P
note that "soundmegs" are taken FROM THE HUNK now to fix the leak
so you need to increase com_hunkmegs by 2x your com_soundmegs

removed the explicit and incorrect "fastsky==1 == disable portals" test

r_noportals is not a cheat var

hyperspace is a bit less annoying

purged the unused (never finished) idMD4 model code

fixed some bugs in referencedpak list generation

fixed roqs ignoring s_volume

fixed widescreen modes crashing on listen servers

fixed downloads not completing properly


18 Feb 08 - 1.41

removed all bs references to GT_SINGLE_PLAYER and ui_singlePlayerActive
(except from the bot code, which has bigger problems)
added sv_singleplayer

improved TTF overhead a lot: now as fast as crappy bitmap fonts  :D

removed the stupidity of every key aborting demo playback: now ESC only

only play the id logo cin the FIRST time, not every fkn time

removed the broken stencil/projection shadow code

avis produced by \video actually work (bug+fix both from ioq3)

fixed some ABSURD buffer overruns and broken code in snd_dma
which caused random dropped sounds for no reason
it's a miracle it doesn't segfault any real OS
also dumped the unused-since-TA adpcm/mulaw/etc cruft

fixed a TA-era (surprise, surprise) bug that broke loopsound behavior

loop (ie ambient) sounds are now 75% volume

q3config is NEVER autowritten just because of bind/cvar changes
it sucks if you're playing and it sucks even more if you're on GTV
UI/SP code should write it EXPLICITLY if they want to save something


19 Dec 07 - 1.40

the code now requires a C++ compiler
MASSIVE cleanups of the codebase, tho still plenty of bits left

screenshot filename is YYYY_MM_DD-HH_MM_SS-TTT
this means they'll never collide *; moviemakers won't run out;
and the engine DOESN'T STAT 10,000 FILES EVERY FRAME
(* except at 2am on an autumn night if you're amazingly unlucky :P)

demo filename is YYYY_MM_DD-HH_MM_SS

fixed demos to be MAX_OSPATH instead of MAX_QPATH, ie 256 chars now

renamed cl_mouseAccel to m_accel

removed ioq3 "qkey" rubbish

removed support for BMP and PCX

removed fs_cdpath, fs_copyfiles, touchfile, fs_restrict

removed support for IPX

removed in_logitechbug

updated cpu detection

added TTF support

fixed a bunch of stuff in ScanAndLoadShaderFiles, but it's still crap

fixed the patch collision epsilon bugs of 1.34

reverted to id's tab-completion since ioq3's is so hated
i've semi-merged them atm, will fix up when i get time

interpreted vm is never used on platforms that support compiled vm

clampmaps and nomip images use GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE rather than GL_CLAMP

disabled curl until it's brought up to standard

merged platform-specific *_net.* into qcommon/net_ip.cpp, <3 timbo  :)

fixed USERINFO vars not being sent properly during connect

remove some network stuff (buffer sizes and TOS) http://support.microsoft.com/kb/248611


12 Sep 07 - released as 1.34, since it was about time we did  :P

increased default MAX_POLYS to 8K and MAX_POLYVERTS to 32K


Aug 07

fixed a bug in the skybox code that tried to use a 0-length CVA
which makes recent nvidia drivers go into spaz mode 

changed r_ext_multisample default to 0 to stop ix nagging  :P


July 07

added support for curl

improved some network stuff (buffer sizes and TOS)

added support for mouse5-mouse8


1 May 07

remove broken useless cl_freezeDemo and make demo pausing work
just use timescale 0


27 Apr 07

ripped out all support for legacy substandard hw/drivers (ie Voodoo etc)
and r_maskMinidriver

uncorrected mode 8 back to 1280x1024



18 Jul 06

update various cvar defaults
r_stencilbits: 0
r_picmip: 0
r_roundImagesDown: 0
r_simpleMipMaps: 0
s_useOpenAL: 0

default fs_game to cpma


30 Jun 06 - initial build from ioq3 svn v810

mode 8 corrected to 1280x960

undefined USE_OPENAL

removed GetUserName call

removed stupid+broken r_dlightbacks

created dlight texture correctly

fixed the dlight code

removed the explicit and incorrect "vertexlight==1 == disable dlights" test

removed redundant r_ext_texture_filter_anisotropic

removed retarded cl_consoleHistory

removed redundant cl_autoRecordDemo

shader spew made developer 1

gl extensions spew made developer 1

pak list made fs_debug 1

removed the TA cvars that were hacked into the engine

reordered demo_protocols to reduce spew
