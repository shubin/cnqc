BLOOD RUN

This is the official engine used by Blood Run game. It is a variation of Challenge Quake3 engine (https://www.playmorepromode.com/guides/cnq3-presentation)
There are several small engine extensions so no other engines would run Blood Run "out of the box".
However, almost any of them could be patched quite easily to support Blood Run.
So, if you want to play Blood Run with your loved quake3e/whatever engine, you can patch it yourself -- it's not that difficult but has to be done accurately.
